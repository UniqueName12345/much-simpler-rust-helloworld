# My (non-stupid) take on mTvare6/hello-world.rs
...yeah, as it turns out, mTvare6 spent so many lines on something that can be done in **3**.

## Changes
I:
- Removed unnessecary bloat
- Removed the need for cargo (seriously? cargo? for a blooming HELLO WORLD?)
- Trimmed down the actual executable script from a lot of lines down to just a measly 3
- Did some other changes here and there.

## Credits
Special thanks to:
- The rust book, for teaching me how to rust
- ChatGPT, for the added humour in this readme.

Special _non_-thanks to:
- mTvare6, who managed to waste so many lines on something that can be replicated in 3

## Time to compile
If I'm correct, it should only take ~1 second to compile and run! Much faster than upstream's **2 hours**.
